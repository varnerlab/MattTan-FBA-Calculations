# MattTan-FBA-Calculations
Flux Balance Analysis calculations for the Matt Tan problem

## Instructions
This code requires [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) version `1.9.x` or above. In addition, it uses several external packages. To install these packages, start the [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/), e.g., from a Terminal window in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) in the root directory of the project (same directory as `Include.jl`) and issue the command:

```
julia> include("Include.jl")
```

This will download and compile the packages required for the project.
